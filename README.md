# Tasky
Task Management System Assignment

Required Endpoints
Authentication Endpoints
- [x] POST /signup – Create a new user (store securely with hashed password)
- [x] POST /token – Login with username and password (OAuth2 password flow)
Task Endpoints (Protected)
- [x] POST /tasks — Create a task
- [x] GET /tasks — List all tasks for the logged-in user
- [x] GET /tasks/{id} — Get a specific task
- [x] PUT /tasks/{id} — Update task status
- [x] DELETE /tasks/{id} — Delete task
Data Models
- [x] Task Model
    - id: int (autogenerated)
    - user_id: FK to users
    - title: string
    - description: string
    - status: enum ("pending", "completed")
    - created_at: timestamp
- [x] User Model
    - id: int
    - username: string (unique)
    - hashed_password: string
Authentication Requirements
All /tasks routes must be protected using BOTH:
1. OAuth2 Password Flow with JWT
    - [x] Use POST /signup to create a user and POST /token to get a JWT
    - [x] Protect all task routes using the JWT token
    - [x] Return only the current user's tasks
2. API Key Header
    - [x] Require X-API-Key: 123456 in all protected requests
    - [x] Reject requests missing or with an invalid key
Technical Requirements
    - [x] Use FastAPI
    - [x] Use SQLite database
    - [x] Use async endpoints where applicable
    - [x] Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
    - [x] Hash passwords securely 
    - [x] Implement basic error handling (404, 401, validation errors)
Delivery Requirements
    • Push to a public GitHub repository
    • Deploy live to Render, Railway, Vercel, or any platform
    • Include a comprehensive README.md with: 
        ◦ Project setup instructions
        ◦ How to create a user and login
        ◦ Example of using the JWT + API Key authentication
        ◦ API documentation
        ◦ Live deployment URL

Evaluation Criteria
    • Functionality: It works as specified
    • Code Quality: Clean, modular code
    • Git Practices: Meaningful commits
    • Deployment: Live deployment accessible
    • Security: Proper JWT + API key authentication
    • Bonus: Clean architecture (e.g., routers, services, models separation)
